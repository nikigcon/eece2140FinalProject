wordle

In Wordle the player is given five chances to guess a five-lettered word and for each letter of their guess the color of the letter is changed according to its degree of correctness. The color legend is as follows: green for correct letter and placement, yellow for correct letter and incorrect placement, and black/gray for incorrect letter and placement. In my version of the Wordle, instead of guessing a five-lettered word each gameplay will randomly have a 4, 5, 6, or 7-lettered word to guess; all other features of the game remain the same.
